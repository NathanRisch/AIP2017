Introduction to programming: a self-learning guide
==================================================

Christophe Pallier 2017

This is a proposed road map to teach yourself programmin using some  excellent resources available on the web. 


# Start from Scratch

Scratch (https://scratch.mit.edu/) is a programming language designed to teach programming to complete beginners. 

For a quick start, read the _Getting Started Tutorial_ (https://resources.scratch.mit.edu/www/guides/en/Getting-Started-Guide-Scratch2.pdf)

Then, follow the document
http://www.pallier.org/crash-course-in-programming-with-scratch.html#crash-course-in-programming-with-scratch

Test yourself: try to program a Pong Game (a solution is provided in the tutorial  "Create a Pong Game")


# How computers work?

## _Computer Science Unplugged / L'informatique sans ordinateur_

Goto http://csunplugged.org/ and read the sections of the book  
http://csunplugged.org/books/ about the representations of integer numbers, images and text. Of course, you can read more if you like it.

Test: You should be able to write an algorithm (a recipies) to determine the binary representation of a given integer number.


## Low-level programming: Machine language 

Read Chapter 24 "The seven secrets of computers revealed" of Daniel Dennett's _Intuition Pumps And Other Tools for Thinking_ (I recommend to buy this book, but if you do not have it, an older version of this text is available at http://sites.tufts.edu/rodrego/files/2011/03/Secrets-of-Computer-Power-Revealed-2008.pdf)

Test: Implement at least the Programs 1, 2, 3 and 4 described in the chapter using the Register Machine simulation "RodRego" available at http://sites.tufts.edu/rodrego/ 


## Hardware (optional) 

If you want to understand computers at the hardware level, you can read  _How computers work_ by Roger Young  http://www.fastchip.net/howcomputerswork/bookbpdf.pdf
or the more advanced _The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles_ by  Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken: http://www1.idc.ac.il/tecs/plan.html and http://www.nand2tetris.org/

# Introduction to Programming in Python 


## On-line courses

You could follow Part #1 of  Openclassroom's Python lecture  
https://openclassrooms.com/courses/apprenez-a-programmer-en-python

or Code Academy's Python course https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python

## Books

First of all, install Python 3 from https://www.continuum.io/downloads

Then, select one of the following books and study it, trying to run the  examples and solve the exercices.

-  _Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python_ by Al Sweigart. http://inventwithpython.com


-  _Think Python. How to Think Like a Computer Scientist_ by Allen B. Downey http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/ 
   
   
(Tthere are other editions _How to Think Like a Computer Scientist. Learning with Python 3_ http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/ 
   * A (slightly different) online version also exists:
https://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/GeneralIntro/intro-TheWayoftheProgram.html

- If you find these books to easy, you can read the _Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python_ by John Guttag (https://www.amazon.fr/Introduction-Computation-Programming-Using-Python/dp/0262525003)


# More advanced programming

- Thinking Complexity 2nd Edition by Allen B. Downey http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-complexity/  The code is available from https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkComplexity2

- Software Carpentry. https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/ . In particular, see the lessons _The Unix Shell_ and _Version Control with Git_.

- _Scipy Lecture Notes: One document to learn numerics, science, and data with Python_ by  Emmanuelle Gouillart, Olav Vahtras and GaÃ«l Varoquaux http://www.freetechbooks.com/scipy-lecture-notes-one-document-to-learn-numerics-science-and-data-with-python-t1021.html
