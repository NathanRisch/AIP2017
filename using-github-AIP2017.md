The lecture materials are stored in a github repository at https://github.com/chrplr/AIP2017/

They will be frequently updated during the course. We will take advantage of git to facilitate this process.

You should make a local copy of these materials on your computer:

**Linux/MacOS**

- _First time download_: Open a terminal and type

         git clone https://github.com/chrplr/AIP2017/

  The materials should now be available in the folder `AIP2017`.

- _Updating_: To download updates from the repository, you will just have to type

        cd AIP2017
	    git pull
	

**Windows with GitHub Desktop installed**

- First time Download. Start GitHub Desktop and click on "Clone a Repository".
When asked to enter a "repository URL or a Github username and repo name", type `chrplr/AIP2017`. This will download the lecture files in `Documents/Github/AIP2017`. You can now close Github Desktop.

- _Updating_ 

**Windows without Github Desktop**

1. Open  https://github.com/chrplr/AIP2017/ in a Browser.

2. Click the green button "Clone or Download" 

3. Select "Download as Zip"

4. Click on the downloaded zip files to Extract its content.

Unfortunatly, the only way to update the files is to reload the full zip file and extract files again...
